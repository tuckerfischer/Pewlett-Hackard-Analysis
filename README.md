# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overvie

The purpose of this analysis was to determine which positions would be opening up as baby boomers retired and to generate a list of employees who were eligible for a mentorship program to backfill those retiring. 

## Results

We first generated a list of employees who would likely be retiring soon, grouped them by their title and counted each group.

We then generated a list of employees for leadership who would be eligible to backfill these retiring positions. In addition, we duplicated the group by and count criteria on this data set.

  ### Takeaways
      * Focus will need to be on developing engineers and staff
      * There are not as many employees eligible for the mentorship program as potential employees retiring
      * Recruitment needs to be done in order to beef up the technique leader and assistant engineer departments
      * PH customer service will go down as positions remain open and not filled due to a wave of retirements

## Summary

The staff and engineer departments have the most retiring postions specifically the senior staff and senior engineers. In addition, there are less employees eligible for the mentorship program as there are employees potentially retiring. Two additional inqueries that should be made are first a querry to determine the tenure of the mentorship eligible employees in order to determine if they are ready for the next level or not and secondly the average tenure of the retiring employees to better sort through whether or not they are likely to retire in the next couple of years.
